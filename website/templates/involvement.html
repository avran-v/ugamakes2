        <p><b>Help with coral reef restoration!</b> <br> <br> SeaTrees was founded in 2018 as a program of the non-profit organization Sustainable Surf to plant, protect, and restore blue carbon coastal ecosystems. Their custom blended carbon offset product, the SeaTrees Token, combines carbon credits with innovative blue carbon projects. Each SeaTrees Token purchased sequesters 1 ton of CO2 via Verified Carbon Standard certified offset projects, plants 4 mangrove trees, and creates 1 square foot of kelp forest.

        <p><b>Support the planting of seagrass!</b><br><br>Founded by Wolcott Henry in 2003 as a community foundation committed to reversing ocean degradation globally, the Ocean Foundation supports the planting of seagrass. Seagrass meadows are an important carbon sink and store 11% of the ocean’s buried carbon despite only accounting for only 0.1% of the world’s seafloor. Today, Ocean Foundation protects our oceans and coastal ecosystems through conservation initiatives, community foundation services, research and development, and blue carbon offsets.
